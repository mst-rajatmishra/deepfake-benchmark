# A dual benchmarking study of visual forgery and visual forensics technique
In the recent years, the significant emerge of image forgery have reached to such level that human cannot tell apart the fraud. The high quality and straightforward usage of these generative model poses a great threat to information security with fake news and malicious applications, e.g. defamation or blackmailing of celebrities, impersonation of politicians in political warfare, spreading of incorrect rumors for attracting views. As a result, a rich body of fake image detection techniques has been proposed in an attempt to stop this dangerous trend. In this paper, we present a benchmark that provides an in-depth insight of fake image creation and detection techniques in a comprehensive and empirical manner. Specifically, we develop an independent framework that integrates state-of-the-arts fake image generators and detectors, then measure the performance of these techniques with various settings. We also perform an exhaustive analysis of benchmark results to discover the characteristics of the techniques, which serves as a comparative references for this never-ending war between measures and countermeasures.
